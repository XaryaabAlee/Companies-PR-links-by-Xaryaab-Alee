## A New Era in Portable Charging
In an age when mobile devices are essential to daily life, finding a reliable, sustainable way to charge them is more important than ever. EcoCharge™ was developed to solve the dual challenge of **energy independence** and **environmental impact**. By integrating next‑generation photovoltaic cells, TechNova has created a charger that requires no access to conventional electricity — just sunlight.  
EcoCharge™ eliminates the reliance on wall sockets, disposable batteries, and power banks that require frequent recharging. According to TechNova’s internal testing, EcoCharge™ can fully charge a typical smartphone in **90 minutes of direct sunlight** or **under three hours in partial sunlight**.  
> “EcoCharge™ is not just a product; it’s our commitment to a cleaner planet,” said **Alicia Warren**, CEO of TechNova. “We believe innovation should not come at the expense of the environment. Every design decision, from materials to packaging, reflects that belief.”
